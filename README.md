# Speed comparison Python vs JavaScript

Speed comparison of Python vs JavaScript to find out which language is faster
for different tasks.

The comparison is based on the following tasks:

1. Numerical computation (sum of squares with 10^9 iterations)
1. String manipulation (concatenate 10^7 random strings of length 10)
1. Sort list / array (sort 10^7 random integers)
1. Count characters in a string (count specific in a random string of length 10^7)
1. Fibonacci (calculate the 42nd Fibonacci number)
1. Matrix multiplication (multiply two 1000x1000 matrices)
